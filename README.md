# Calorie & Macro Tracker — Ready to Deploy

## What you have
- A ready-to-deploy React project (Create React App style).
- PWA manifest + icons so you can "Add to Home Screen".
- Daily goals panel, food DB (including omelette, eggs, bread, coffee), export/import.

## How to preview instantly (CodeSandbox)
1. Go to https://codesandbox.io
2. Click "Create Sandbox" → choose "Create React App" or "React" template.
3. In CodeSandbox, open `src/App.js` and replace its content with the contents of `src/App.jsx` from this zip.
4. Replace `src/index.js` with `src/index.jsx` content, and add `src/index.css` from this zip.
5. The preview will load automatically.

## How to deploy to Vercel (recommended)
1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `calorie-tracker`) and upload all files from this zip (drag & drop).
3. Create a free Vercel account and connect GitHub.
4. In Vercel, click "New Project" → import your `calorie-tracker` repo → Deploy.
5. Vercel will give you a live URL. That's it.

## How to add to Home Screen (iPhone)
1. Open the deployed URL in Safari.
2. Tap Share → Add to Home Screen.

## Screenshots / step-by-step (quick)
1. GitHub -> New repository -> Name it -> Create.
2. Add file -> Upload files -> Drag the project files -> Commit.
3. Vercel -> New Project -> Import Git Repository -> select repo -> Deploy.

If you want, I can create the GitHub repo for you and add you as a collaborator — tell me your GitHub username and I will prepare the repo content and invite you.
